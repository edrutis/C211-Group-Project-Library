# C211-Group-Project

## Group Members
* Emily Reynolds - Library Class
* Sam Allen - Patron Class
* Monica Galvez - Book Class

## Project Details
We are going to create the library system as described in the project proposal list.

## Instructions
You can use the GUI to do the following things:
-Checkout a book, up to 5 at a time to a Patron
-Return all books a Patron has checked out
-Add a Patron
-View All Patrons
-Add a Book
-View All Books

Use the tabs at the top of GUI to navigate these functions.
You will get pop-up messages when you click a button.
The Library already has one Book and one Patron. 

## Roadmap
We plan to implement more features to help manage the library. Stay tuned!
We also welcome feedback :)
